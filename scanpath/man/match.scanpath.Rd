\title{Identify scanpath patterns}
\usage{
match.scanpath(l, groups, expr, subpattern = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{l}{a vector of single letters or single-digit integers each
representing a fixation on a region of interest.}

\item{groups}{a grouping variable indicating to which scanpath each
fixation belongs.  The search for matching patterns in performed
within each group separately and matches crossing group
boundaries are not considered.}

\item{expr}{a regular expression describing the scanpath pattern of
interest.}

\item{subpattern}{the subpattern of interest.  If zero, the
complete match will be marked.  If n>0, only the n-th subpattern
will be marked.  See examples.}
}
\value{
A vector giving the indices of the matching
  fixations.  Only the first match within each scanpath will be
  marked.
}
\description{
Identifies sequences of fixations that match a pattern specified
using a regular expression.
}
\examples{
data(eyemovements)
words <- eyemovements$word
trial <- eyemovements$trial

# Scanpaths from the last word until the end of the trial:
idx <- match.scanpath(words, trial, "8.+")
scanpaths1 <- eyemovements[idx,]
plot_scanpaths(scanpaths1, duration~x|trial)

# Scanpaths from third word until a fixation on the second word:
idx <- match.scanpath(words, trial, "3.+2")
scanpaths2 <- eyemovements[idx,]
plot_scanpaths(scanpaths2, duration~x|trial)

# Find scanpaths from the third word until the end of the trial but
# only if they contain a fixation on the second word:
idx <- match.scanpath(words, trial, "3.+2.*")
scanpaths3 <- eyemovements[idx,]
plot_scanpaths(scanpaths3, duration~x|trial)

# Find scanpaths spanning words 6, 7, and 8 but only those that
# are directly preceded by a fixation on word 4:
idx <- match.scanpath(words, trial, "4([678]+)", subpattern=1)
scanpaths4 <- eyemovements[idx,]
plot_scanpaths(scanpaths4, duration~word|trial)
