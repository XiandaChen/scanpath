Version 1.06
============
Fixation durations are no longer logarithmized when calculating
scanpath similarity.

Version 1.02
============
Added function which.mean that can be used to indentify prototypical scanpaths. 

Version 1.01
============
Fixed two problem in the functions for plotting scanpaths regarding the
treatment of factors:

 1.) When using factors for regions of interest (ROIs), the display dropped
 unused ROIs on the x-axis rendering a somewhat misleading picture of the
 scanpaths.

 2.) When using factors for a grouping variable (e.g. condition), it could
 happen that plot.scanpaths confused the colors when at least one level in the
 factor did not occur in a plot.

Version 1.0
============
First official release.
